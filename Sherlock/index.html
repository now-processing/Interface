        <p>
          In Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads
          of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues,
          and put together the facts to reach a solution. Why were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing
          paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your
          ingenuity and deductive abilities.

        <h1>The Thames Murders</h1>
        <img class="left" src="images/brownbox.png" alt="box cover">
        <p>
          The gaslight streets of Victorian London. Horse-drawn broughams, hansoms, and dog-carts rattle over the cobblestone
          streets, pulling their passengers through the pea-soup fog. On every street corner, you pass booksellers, clubs,
          prisons, music halls, doctors, tea houses, and steamship companies. Yet in the shadows and dark alleys of this great
          city, horrible and cunning crimes are committed daily, confounding the policemen of Scotland Yard. Still, even the most
          ingenious crime is only a puzzle for the world's only consulting detective - Sherlock Holmes!

          Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective line: Carlton House & Queen's Park!
